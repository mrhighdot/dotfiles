# Config v1.0.0

In order for the configs to be applied, clone the files to the config hidden folder as follows:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrhighdot/dotfiles.git ~/.config #Mac & Linux
```

Well, I use macOS and Linux(sometimes :)) so feel free to clone and modify the configs as you see fit

# Things I use (currently on macOS)
- Sketchybar (Pretty thing at the top of my screen X))
- Yabai (Tiling Window Manager)
- skhd (One-key press for screen navigation)
- kitty terminal (main)
- alacritty terminal
- tmux (terminal multiplexer)
- zellij (tmux on crack, but use it sometimes)
- Nix package manager (don't like Homebrew)

you can infer from the rest fam...

And please, refer to the docs of the various items to set them up properly on your system!
Enjoy!
